# ai-api-translator

This repository is about applying the Langchain framework to use LLM models to translate text. It was used OpenAI GPT as model to translate the input text from the user. An API with the chain model was built, so it is possible to apply the concept in another application. The user can type in a text and choose which language they want to translate it to.
